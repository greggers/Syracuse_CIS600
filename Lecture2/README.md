# Lecture 2: Understanding Data Sampling and Dimensionality

## Overview
This lecture explores fundamental concepts in data sampling and the challenges of high-dimensional spaces using Python examples to illustrate the curse of dimensionality and sampling techniques.

## The Curse of Dimensionality

### Dimensional Scaling
In curse_of_dimensionality.py, we explore how space grows exponentially with dimensions:
```python
dimensions = np.arange(1, 11)
```
This demonstrates how the volume of the sample space increases dramatically as dimensions increase.

### Practical Implications
The code illustrates several key concepts:
- How density of points decreases with higher dimensions
- Why sampling becomes increasingly difficult in high-dimensional spaces
- The impact on machine learning and data analysis

### Visualization
The program provides various visualizations:
- 1D and 2D Gaussian distributions
- Density plots
- Dimensional scaling effects

## Sampling Techniques Explained

### Uniform Random Sampling
In sampling_example.py, we demonstrate basic uniform random sampling:
```python
samples_1d_uniform = np.random.uniform(0, 1, n_samples)
```
This represents the simplest form of sampling, where each point has an equal probability of being selected.

### Monte Carlo Sampling
The program shows advanced sampling techniques using Monte Carlo methods:
```python
samples_1d_mc = np.random.beta(2, 2, n_samples)
```
This demonstrates importance sampling, where we concentrate points in areas of particular interest.

### Function Estimation
Our examples show how different sampling methods affect function estimation:
```python
def f_2d(x, y):
    return np.sin(2 * np.pi * x) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * y)
```
This helps visualize how sampling strategies impact our ability to estimate complex functions.

## Conclusion
These examples demonstrate the critical importance of choosing appropriate sampling strategies and understanding the challenges of high-dimensional data in machine learning and data analysis applications.
