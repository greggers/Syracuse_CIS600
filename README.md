# Data Science Course Materials

This repository contains lecture materials, code examples, and visualizations for a comprehensive data science course.

## Course Structure

### Lecture 1: Data Science Overview
An introduction to the field of data science, covering fundamental concepts, methodologies, and applications. This lecture provides a broad overview of what data science is and how it's applied across various domains.

### Lecture 2: Data Sampling Methods
A deep dive into data types, structures, and sources. This lecture explores how data is collected, organized, and prepared for analysis, with a focus on understanding data characteristics and quality.

## Code Examples

The repository includes Python code examples demonstrating key data science concepts:

- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Visualizations showing how the distribution of points changes as dimensions increase, using Gaussian distributions in 1D and 2D spaces.
- **Sampling Methods**: Implementations of uniform random sampling and Monte Carlo sampling with visualizations to demonstrate their effectiveness in different scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Running the Examples
Each Python script can be executed directly:
```bash
python curse_of_dimensionality.py
python sampling_visualization.py
```

## Visualizations

The code examples generate visualizations to help understand complex data science concepts:

- Distribution of points in different dimensional spaces
- Comparison of sampling techniques
- Function estimation using different sampling methods

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to improve the course materials or add new examples.
