# Data Science Course Materials

This repository contains lecture materials, code examples, and visualizations for a comprehensive data science course.

## Course Structure

### Lecture 1: Data Science Overview
An introduction to the field of data science, covering fundamental concepts, methodologies, and applications. This lecture provides a broad overview of what data science is and how it's applied across various domains.

### Lecture 2: Data Sampling Methods
A deep dive into data types, structures, and sources. This lecture explores how data is collected, organized, and prepared for analysis, with a focus on understanding data characteristics and quality.

### Lecture 3: Data Visualization
A comprehensive guide to data visualization techniques, including using Excel, matplotlib, and graph databases. This lecture covers the art of presenting data in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner.

### Lecture 4: Decision Trees
A detailed exploration of decision trees, their construction using ID3 and CART algorithms, and their applications in classification and regression tasks. This lecture delves into the principles and practical applications of decision trees.

### Lecture 5: Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Selection
A comprehensive guide to evaluating and selecting models, including techniques for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. This lecture covers the importance of model evaluation and how to choose the right model for a given problem. With selections discussing, 
resubstitution, cross-validation, and other methods.

## Code Examples

The repository includes Python code examples demonstrating key data science concepts:

- **Curse of Dimensionality**: Visualizations showing how the distribution of points changes as dimensions increase, using Gaussian distributions in 1D and 2D spaces.
- **Sampling Methods**: Implementations of uniform random sampling and Monte Carlo sampling with visualizations to demonstrate their effectiveness in different scenarios.
- **Figure Generation**: An example of generating figures using matplotlib and scikit, showcasing how to create informative and visually appealing plots.
- **Decision Tree Example**: A simple implementation of a decision tree for classification tasks, demonstrating how to build and use decision trees for predictive modeling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required packages: numpy, matplotlib, scipy

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Running the Examples
Each Python script can be executed directly:
```bash
python curse_of_dimensionality.py
python sampling_visualization.py
```

## Visualizations

The code examples generate visualizations to help understand complex data science concepts:

- Distribution of points in different dimensional spaces
- Comparison of sampling techniques
- Function estimation using different sampling methods
